# Heartbeat Tasks

This file is checked every 30 minutes by your nanobot agent.
Add tasks below that you want the agent to work on periodically.

If this file has no tasks (only headers and comments), the agent will skip the heartbeat.

### Memory Consolidation (runs every heartbeat)
During each heartbeat, review recent conversations and events using the memory_consolidate tool:
1. Identify new knowledge worth saving (user preferences, important events, learned skills)
2. Check for memories that need updating (information changes, confidence adjustments)
3. Clean up outdated or redundant memories
4. Ensure consistency across different persona branches
